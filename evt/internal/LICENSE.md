### NOTE:

The implement of the event rounting mechanism is inspired by the awesome [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter).

Most of the hard works (`path`, `tree`, `routergroup`) are forked and customed from [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) and [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).

All of the related source codes are governed by [httprouter LICENSE](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter/blob/master/LICENSE) and [Gin LICENSE](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/blob/master/LICENSE).
