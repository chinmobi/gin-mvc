# Gin-MVC
The MVC framework based on Gin.

The framework integrates MVC-developing patterns to build a RESTful web application (especially, the microservice application).
The framework is lightweight and flexible, easy to extend and configure, and additionally with essential facilities to build an enterprise product project. Especially, the project is out of box. You could clone the project, rename the project's mod name, and then start your business-logic developing work.
The project acts as a starter to build a real RESTful, MVC-style web application.
